# To Do App

Hello again!! This project, is a To Do List App, that allows you to **_Add_**, **_Delete_** and **_Filter_** tasks, according to the user preferences. It's functionality is developed with plain **Vanilla JavaScript**, using _arrow functions_ to control its functionality.

The _Styling_ was developed with **CSS**, and it's inspired in other popular app, designed for the same purpose, but with my personal touch.

## Current Functionality

- Add new tasks or notes to the list and display them for the user.
- Delete the tasks one by one, once they are completed.
- Search or filter by character appearance, the displayed tasks or notes.

## Future Functionality to Implement

- Develop an **_Edit_** option, to change and update an already created task.
- Display the already created tasks, with time and date of creation.
- Instead of deleting a task upon completion, display it as _completed_ in a separate list with date and time.
- Implement user creation and password access to make use of the application.
